### This wasn’t just a problem—it was a taunt. And I don’t take taunts lightly.

This extension is especially for people using Chrome on Linux whose "back/forward two-finger swipe navigation gesture" does not work. God that's a long thing to say

I love how it turned out though. Personally, I feel it's better than the native one (obviously)\
Spent a lot of time trying to build Gnome extension only to find Gnome only captures touchdown and touchup events from two-finger gestures. Swipe gestures (as scroll events) are handled by the app itself. Downloaded available Chrome extensions, but they were half baked and buggy. After a long week of programming in languages I didn't want to, built something far more polished and reliable.


## Features:
 1. Swipe back forth to navigate
 2. Quick on/off toggle button
 3. Customizability
    1. Arrow Size
    2. Sensitivity
    3. Arrow Fade Delay  
    4. Icon Travel Distance
    5. Select Custom Arrow Style
 4. **Upcoming** (if enough traction):
    1. Pull down to refresh (as in phones)
    2. Pinch to zoom
    3. Upload custom svg feat
    4. Certainly more icon styles
